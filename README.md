# The Nava Set: A Spatial Energy Framework for Systemic Biological Longevity

## 🧠 Overview

The Nava Set is a mathematical model designed to reduce entropy in complex biological systems by optimizing internal energy distribution. This framework proposes a structure for extending the functional lifespan of biological organisms through efficient, fractal-like energy scaling.

### Core Formula:
```
A = ((√n - 1)R + R)² = nR²
```
Where:
- `n` = number of active units (e.g., cells, mitochondria)
- `R` = unit resource radius (energy per cell)
- `A` = total preserved surface area or energy

This configuration enables more effective energy management, delays degradation, and—when paired with nanotech—simulates 2.5x to 3.5x lifespan extension in hostile environments.
